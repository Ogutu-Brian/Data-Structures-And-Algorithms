Python Implementation of Various Algorithms and Abstract Data Types

## Algorithm: 
    An algorithm is a sequence of unambiguous instructions for solving a problem, i.e, for obtaining a required output for any legitimate input in a finite amount of time

## Data Structure
    A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

## Data Structures Covered
    1. Array
    2. Linked List
    3. Stack
    4. Queue
    5. Graph
    6. Tree
    7. Heap

## Other sections
    1. Hashing
    2. Matrix
    3. Misc 
   
## Fundamentals of Algorithmic Problem Solving
1. Understand the problem
2. Ascertain the capabilities of computational device
3. Choose between exact and approximate problem solving
4. Design the algorithm
